			<h1>Downtowns Daily Cup of Joe</h1>


			<p>In SMAD 203, I created the User Research, User Experience, Wireframe, Metadata, and Site Map for a potential app or website called Downtown’s Daily Cup of Joe. The design was created for Harrisonburg’s Downtown area local coffee shops to help increase the traffic and business to these locations over on-campus coffee outlets like Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks. The app included design ideas of online purchasing, order ahead options, business traffic and in-site location availabilities (ex: how many tables are available, how long are lines, busy hours), the ability for app/website users to use FLEX or Dining Dollars, and other features that mimic coffee apps like Starbucks but used for multiple local, small business coffee site locations. </p>

			<p>With the current research and experience that I have previously collected, I aim to create an app, website, or both to achieve the design requirements that are established. Due to external influences of the COVID-19 pandemic and have had collected this research in years prior, I plan to conduct further research to more adequately develop a product that JMU students, professors, and community would better align with the daily lives of these individuals. </p>


			<p>I aim to create and develop a product that JMU’s institution and Harrisonburg’s public would desire to use to increase the quality of their morning or afternoon coffee runs. The impact of the pandemic has affected small businesses and the average routine of professor and students; thus, I would like to provide resources for these individuals to better their studying and creative environment. This product would be simple and effective to use, following along with basic design principles. It will also be inclusive to all communities through ensuring there are options for long names, ability to prefer a non-binary gender option, and other features. I desire to implement features to this product in order for it to be engaging and interactive leaving the user with a sense of fulfillment. </p>

			<p>With my User Research, I created two personas to be the Daily Cup of Joe’s target audience. Both these personas were students, one being an undergraduate and the other being in graduates’ school, at James Madison University. The audience I desire to reach is broader now as I see the importance of such a product for more than just the JMU student population. The audience I will market this product for will vary depending on my upcoming research, but I am currently brainstorming ideas for the Daily Cup of Joe to be for students, professors, and young adults within the Harrisonburg community.</p>
