			<h1 text align="center">SMAD 408 Independent Project Proposal</h1>

			<h2 text align="center">Revive.</h2>
			<p text align="center">A complementary addition to my hand-coded webpage <i><a href="https://jblaaise.github.io/therawrevival/" target="_blank">The Raw Revival</a></i></p>


			<h3>Overview:</h3>

			<p>For my Independent Project, I plan to create a new concept that revolves around a great passion of mine - Fashion Sustainability. Lately, there has been a movement towards making the internal structure of the fashion industry more ethical and environmentally friendly. This movement is incredibly important for each and every one of us due to the fact of the matter that the fashion industry is one of the highest polluting industries. </p>

			<p>My idea for my Independent project is based around the functionality and concept of Honey, a free browser extension that searches the web for deals and coupons. Revive will also be a free browser extension that will give its user data and information regarding their buying habits in hopes of lowering these individual users environmental impact when online shopping for clothing items and accessories. To begin this project, I must conduct user research through surveys, interviews, and other research regarding fashion sustainability and we browser extension functionality. Once I am able to accumulate enough information and data, I will further my Independent Project with developing a design and prototype for this extension, along with its own webpage wireframe containing the user’s profile and information about Revive.</p>


			<h3>Goals:</h3>

			<p>My primary goal for this project is to introduce users to their individual contribution of pollution through their clothing and accessory purchases. I hope that the abilities that I plan for this web extension to have are beneficial to the consumer along with being effective in how they view their purchases and care about the impact they make in our environment. This project is important because fast fashion tends to be highly overlooked by consumers due to lower prices and a negligence to care. Consumers know that fast fashion stores such as Shein and Zara have bad reputations when it comes to working conditions, fast fashion practices, and environmental pollution but these consumers overlook said  issues because they believe their individual efforts won’t result in any beneficial change in the fashion industry nor will it stop these companies from continuing their practices. I personally believe that this project is very important since consumers don’t physically see how impactful their purchasing patterns are towards the environment, and I think that if these consumers are given the ability to see how harmful a purchase is they will take a step back to look at the bigger picture and possibly reconsider their purchases and where they buy from. </p>

			<p>Additionally, I have previously created a webpage along with conducting a decent amount of research on fashion sustainability, which are both currently displayed within my portfolio, that I believe furthering my knowledge and skills on this topic will further advance the content within my portfolio. Through researching and developing this concept, I hope I gain a new insight on how web browser extensions function, add a new web prototype to my portfolio that has multiple layers, and learn more about how to be more sustainable in my own everyday life.</p>

			<h3>Audience:</h3>

			<p>The audience for my project is essentially universal. My intended audience would be any gender of online clothing shoppers starting at the age of 15 years old and up. I choose starting at 15-years-old because that tends to be the age of when people become consumers of online clothing shopping. Through further research, this age range has the potential to change as survey and interview results calculated. </p>


			<h3>Timeline:</h3>
			<p>Timeline is subject to change as completion dates and other projects have taken importance within SMAD 408.</p>

			<h3>Inspiration:</h3>
			<p>Below are two current web browser extensions that I plan to inspire Revive. Web Extension after. Both these below have well-thought out functionalities and design that have helped me create the concept of Revive.</p>
